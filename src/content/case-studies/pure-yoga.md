    <strong>When Pure Yoga got in touch with fffood, they already had a strong sense of who they were:</strong> a trusted teacher offering in-person, online and 1-to-1 yoga sessions. What they didn’t have was a digital setup that worked.

The original website had been built in WordPress by a now-unavailable supplier. Domains weren’t in her control. A legacy Squarespace account was also in the mix. Everything was a bit stuck. Through a local network connection, she asked if we could help. We said yes — and got to work tidying things up.

This wasn’t a big rebrand or a full digital transformation. It was more like digital DIY: recovering access, fixing broken links, moving platforms, and making everything easier to manage

We rebuilt the website in Squarespace, integrating Momence for booking and scheduling. We created window graphics, A-boards, flyers — whatever was needed. We worked with the original visual direction, adding polish where we could, and focused on giving her control over her own setup again.

    “Nick was exactly what I needed — calm, practical, and completely on my side. He helped me untangle a tricky situation with my old website and supplier, and brought everything together into one place I could finally manage. The site, the graphics, the flyers — he just made it all work. I trust him completely.”

This one’s ongoing — and a nice example of what we mean by fffood being “big-brand thinking made accessible.” We don’t just do polish. We also do pick-up-the-pieces-and-make-it-work.
