Culture Rebel is an HR and training consultancy that doesn’t play by the old rules — but their original website didn’t quite get that across.

They’d built it themselves in Squarespace, and the content was solid. But the structure felt muddled, the layout too safe, and the visuals didn’t match the spirit of the business. We’d crossed paths through other projects, and they asked if fffood could help dial things up.

We rebuilt the site in Squarespace, restructured the content, and pushed the visual direction into grittier, more urban territory — pulling from skate culture, graffiti, and rock and roll. This wasn’t a rebrand, but it felt like a truer expression of who they are.

The new creative also fed into social assets and Canva templates, helping them keep everything on-brand and consistent across channels.

    “We’d built the bones of a site ourselves, but it didn’t quite reflect who we are. fffood helped us rethink the whole thing — structure, tone, and visuals — and brought a bolder, more rebellious energy to the brand. It’s now unapologetically ‘us’. They got it straight away, and we trusted them to get on with it.”

A simple project, delivered well — and a nice reminder that sometimes all a brand needs is permission to stop playing it safe.
