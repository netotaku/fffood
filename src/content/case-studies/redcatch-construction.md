    <strong>Redcatch Construction came to fffood with no more than an idea and a sense of ambition.</strong> They wanted to launch a new construction and scaffolding business — but didn’t want to look like a startup. They wanted to look like a £5 million outfit from day one.
</div>

They’d had a go at branding via a local printer, and tried speaking to a Clifton agency, but found the whole experience a bit intimidating. Through a referral, they came to us instead — looking for someone who could listen, adapt, and build things properly.

We started from scratch:

 - Developed the brand identity through close collaboration
 - Designed and built the website in Squarespace
 - Created business cards, email footers, and banners for onsite scaffolding
 - Set up domains and Google Workspace to get them up and running smoothly

Because the business was still forming, the brief evolved constantly. Content changed. Priorities shifted. We worked closely to shape things as they emerged — but kept clear boundaries and a smooth process throughout.

<blockquote>
    "We came to fffood with just an idea, and they helped turn it into something real. The branding, the website, the email setup — everything looks and feels like a serious business, and that’s exactly what we wanted. Fffood made the whole process easy, clear, and collaborative. We still go back to fffood for design and support whenever we need it."

Today, Redcatch has a confident, professional brand presence — and we act as their retained creative partner, handling ad hoc graphic design, site updates, and workspace support whenever needed.

Just how we like it: _collaborative, clear, and built to grow._
