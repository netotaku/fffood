    <strong>AI isn’t here to replace creative thinking.</strong> It’s here to make it faster, easier, and more accessible — when it’s used well. At fffood, we use AI as a tool to help us work efficiently, reduce costs, and explore more possibilities for our clients.

We still do the thinking. The strategy, design choices, and creative direction always come from us. AI just helps with the heavy lifting.

### Why we use AI

- *Speed* – AI can generate first drafts of copy, content outlines, or design variations in minutes instead of hours.
- *Efficiency* – We can explore more options in the same amount of time, so you get a better end result for your budget.
- *Exploration* – Need to see how a headline works in five different tones? Or what a landing page might look like with a different structure? AI makes it easy to try ideas without over-investing.

### How we use AI in projects
- Drafting website copy, then editing it to fit your brand’s tone and purpose.
- Suggesting layout ideas or content structures before we commit to design.
- Speeding up repetitive or technical tasks, like reformatting data or resizing images.
- Generating code snippets to save time in development.

### How we don’t use AI
- We never let AI decide your strategy — that’s our job.
- We don’t use AI to generate unedited content. Everything is reviewed and refined by us.
- We won’t feed your confidential information into public AI tools.

### What this means for you
Using AI well means your project moves faster, costs less, and has more room for creativity. You still get a solution shaped by experienced people who understand your goals — just with a little extra help from the machines.
