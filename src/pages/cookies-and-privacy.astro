				<p><strong>What we collect</strong></p>

				<h2><span class="u-grey">1.</span> Website analytics</h2>
				
				<p>We use <a href="https://counter.dev" target="_blank">Counter.dev</a> to see basic, anonymous stats about our site visitors. This helps us understand things like:</p>	

				<ul>
					<li>Which pages are most popular</li>
					<li>How people find us</li>
					<li>What devices or browsers they use</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Counter.dev is privacy-first:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>It doesn't use cookies</li>
					<li>It doesn't track you across other sites</li>
					<li>It doesn't collect personally identifiable information (PII)</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h2><span class="u-grey">2.</span> Mailing list & CRM</h2>

				<p>If you sign up for our mailing list, we store your name and email address in <a target="_blank" href="https://emailoctopus.com">EmailOctopus</a>.
				
				We use this to send occasional updates about our services, ideas, or projects.

				You can unsubscribe at any time using the link in the email, or by contacting us directly.</p>

				<h2><span class="u-grey">3.</span> Contact forms</h2>

				<p>If you fill in a contact form on our site, we use the details you provide to reply to your message and, if relevant, to follow up on a project enquiry.
				We don't use this information for marketing unless you've explicitly opted in.</p>

				<h2><span class="u-grey">4.</span> Cookies</h2>
				
				<p>We don't use advertising cookies, tracking pixels, or any other cookie-based analytics tools.

				The only cookies you might see are those essential to the operation of services we embed (for example, if you interact with certain embedded forms).</p>

				<h2><span class="u-grey">5.</span> Your rights</h2>
				
				<p>You have the right to:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Request a copy of the personal data we hold about you</li>
					<li>Ask us to correct, update, or delete your information</li>
					<li>Withdraw consent for us to contact you</li>
					<li>To exercise these rights, email us at <a href="mailto:desk@fffood.agency">desk@fffood.agency</a>.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2><span class="u-grey">6.</span> Changes to this policy</h2>

				<p>We may update this page from time to time to reflect changes in the law or in the tools we use.
				Any significant changes will be noted here with the date of the update.</p>
